In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing some financial records for a fictitious company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.


I had to create a Python script to analyze the records & calculate each of the following:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script displays the results in the terminal and prints the output to an external text file.
